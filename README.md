Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project was to make a program to be able to track and render the amount of repeated words in a file. This is aimed at making a solution to wanting to track the popularity of certain items at a grocery store. These sorts of prgrams can be very applicable and can have many uses outside of the one that I worked to solve.
What did you do particularly well?

I think I do pretty good at solving the specific issues I have woth the code. I was having a very difficult time firguring out the virtual lab, so I moved to a local file, I have had issues with the code I have figured out in my own creative ways. I yry to be relavant and innovative woth my solutions, and though sometimes it looks clunky, I take pride in solving things myself.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I definitely have issues mastering certain portions of the code. I can get caught up in what I know and what I don't know and just make things too complex. I can definitely use more time to master certain aspects and how yo make them more efficient.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I find the pieces of code that interact with other files to be sort of difficult to write. It can be very easy to make a mistake with how you interact with other programs or files, and I can struggle figuring out how that works specifically. I have been trying to simply get a better handle on the mechanics and have been trying to create more cool unique ways to solve these issues. The challenges can only lead to more innovative solutions.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I gained all of the C++ skills from this. I knew nothing of the language before, but know I know a fair bit. Working with exterior files is also something I had not touched on a ton in the past, and that will definitely be relevant as well.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I have been trying to do a better job at using in line notes to keep my programs readable and easy for someone to change. Making sure that others can figure out what you are intending to do with your programs as well as change anything that may have fallen out of date is crucial within a program you are writing for a customer.
